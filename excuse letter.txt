Good day Ma'am Justine,

	I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to inform you that I was not able to attend the AI Fundamentals class held last February 13, 2025, due to fever and rashes which could be early symptoms of Dengue. 

	Mosquitoes have recently frequented the campus grounds which could be attributed to the university's forested landscape.  As a safety precaution amidst the outbreak of the disease in Quezon City, I decided to stay at home and monitor myself, wary of the possible adverse effects that could follow upon contracting or spreading the disease. Especially since I was a recipient of the controversial Dengvaxia vaccine. 

	It took me a while to catch up with the lessons and tasks so I apologize for the delayed submission and thank you for your understanding and consideration.

								Best regards.
